### About
I have worked on this bot for over 2 years, ~15k LoC. It has been since completely ported to the newest version of Travian T4.5. Bot is under active development (at least until summer 2021). Instructions are on the Discord channel. If you have any question/recommendation, feel free to contact me (on Discord).

## Features
#### - Auto-Change proxy
TBS can change proxy by itself. This means you are far less likely to be banned for using a bot. Main reason for a bot ban is high activity from same IP (12h+). TBS supports proxy authentication.
#### - Auto-Settle new villages
TBS can find appropriate valleys to settle around your capital village. Or you can input coordinates in advance and it will automatically settle one valley after another.
#### - Auto-Fill troops and send resources to/from capital
TBS will automatically send resources from capital village to off/deff villages, train troops there and send the remaining resources back. This is a perfect feature for any deff account.
#### - Attack/Fake at specific time with multiple waves
Dream-come-true for any offensive player.

#### Tech specification
It's a Windows Forms app written in C#. It only works on Windows. My plan is to make a web app for the frontend and I have already ported the TBS Core to the .Net Standard, so it could be used by .Net core project (cross-platform option).
